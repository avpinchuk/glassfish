# Releasing a new GlassFish version

In this example we assume 8.0.1.
If any step failed, you have to resolve the issue and start from the appropriate step again.

1. Create a release branch RELEASE_8.0.1 and push it to the Eclipse GlassFish Github repository.
2. Open [glassfish-release](https://ci.eclipse.org/glassfish/view/GlassFish/job/glassfish-release)
3. Click [Build with parameters](https://ci.eclipse.org/glassfish/view/GlassFish/job/glassfish-release/build) in menu.
    - `releaseVersion` = `8.0.1`
    - `nextVersion` = `8.0.2-SNAPSHOT`
    - click [Build] button.
4. Wait for it to finish successfully
5. Verify that everything was done:
    1. Verify that the deployment is present in [Maven Central Deployments](https://central.sonatype.com/publishing/deployments)
       - It is possible that you will not have permissions to visit the namespace. Ask project leads or
         check if expected artifacts made it to Maven Central, then this was obviously successful.
    2. Verify that a new [8.0.1 tag](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/glassfish/releases/tag/8.0.1) was created.
    3. Verify that the release branch changed the number to the `nextVersion` value.
6. Create a Draft PR based on this branch.
7. Find the `Glassfish Full Profile Distribution` on the page of the release build under [glassfish-release](https://ci.eclipse.org/glassfish/view/GlassFish/job/glassfish-release)
   and copy the URL of the zip file.
8. Run the [TCKs](https://ci.eclipse.org/jakartaee-platform/job/JakartaEE-TCK/view/EFTL-Certification-Jobs-11/) against the result artifact - alternatively
you can deploy to Maven Central Snapshots using [glassfish-deploy-snapshots](https://ci.eclipse.org/glassfish/job/glassfish-deploy-snapshot/)
and refer zip from the build or from Maven Central Snapshots (same file). As another alternative you can run the TCK on any other
infrastructure.
9. Create the release on Github: click ["Draft a new release"](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/glassfish/releases)
10. Create the release on Eclipse: ["Create a new release"](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j.glassfish click)
11. If it is a version with important feature changes, ask for a release review. Remember that it will take more than week.
12. Create the release on Glassfish.org. Do a PR for the **main** branch with:
    -  an update for the website in [`docs/website/src/main/resources`](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/glassfish/tree/master/docs/website/src/main/resources):
        - in [`download_gf8.md`](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/glassfish/tree/master/docs/website/src/main/resources/download_gf7.md),
          create a section for the new version at the top, based on the previous version. Update the info based on the release notes in github,
          e.g. https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/glassfish/releases/tag/8.0.1
        - in [`download.md`](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/glassfish/tree/master/docs/website/src/main/resources/download.md),
          replace information in the "Eclipse GlassFish 8.x" section at the top with info for the new version in `download_gf8.md`
        - check [`README.md`](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/glassfish/blob/master/docs/website/src/main/resources/README.md),
          if release information is still actual.
    - with an update for the docs:
        - Update the property `glassfish.version.8x` with the released version in [docs/pom.xml](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/glassfish/blob/master/docs/pom.xml)
13. Open [Maven Central Deployments](https://central.sonatype.com/publishing/deployments) and click the Publish button.
   Maven Central then distributes artifacts so they will become reachable to anyone referring Maven Central Repository.
14. Verify that it's present in [Maven Central](https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/org/glassfish/main/distributions/glassfish)
   (usually takes few minutes now)
15. Upload the new release to the Eclipse download folder.
    Go to [glassfish-copy-to-downloads](https://ci.eclipse.org/glassfish/job/glassfish-copy-to-downloads)
    - Enter the version to copy; 8.0.1
    - click [Build] button
16. If everything is OK, then merge the PR.
17. Delete the branch after merge, only tag will remain.
18. Create a new Eclipse GlassFish Docker Image - follow [Eclipse GlassFish Docker Image Wiki](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/glassfish.docker/wiki/How-To-Release)
